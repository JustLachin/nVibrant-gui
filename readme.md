## üî• Description

**NVIDIA GPUs** have a nice feature called **Digital Vibrance** that increases the colors saturation of the display. The option is readily available on [nvidia-settings](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-settings/) in Linux, but is too coupled with `libxnvctrl`. Therefore, it's "exclusive" to the X11 display server and unavailable on Wayland; but I paid for them pixels to glow :^)

An interesting observation is that the setting persists after modifying it on X11 and then switching to Wayland. I theorized [[1]](https://github.com/libvibrant/vibrantLinux/issues/27#issuecomment-2729822152) [[2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1gx1hir/comment/mhpe2pk/?context=3) it was possible to call some shared library or interface to configure it directly in their driver, independently of the display server. And indeed, it is possible!

This repository uses `nvidia-modeset` and `nvkms` headers found at [nvidia/open-gpu-kernel-modules](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/) to make [ioctl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioctl) calls in the `/dev/nvidia-modeset` device for configuring display attributes. These headers are synced with the proprietary releases, should work fine if you're on any of `nvidia-dkms`, `nvidia-open` or `nvidia`

**Note**: A future (and intended) way to will be through [NVML](https://developer.nvidia.com/management-library-nvml), as evident by some [nvidia-settings](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-settings/blob/6c755d9304bf4761f2b131f0687f0ebd1fcf7cd4/src/libXNVCtrlAttributes/NvCtrlAttributesNvml.c#L1235) comments

## üì¶ Installation

There's multiple ways to get `nvibrant`:

### 1. Package manager

Help me by packaging it for your distro, get in touch and I'll add it here!

### 2. Prebuilt binaries

You can download the latest builds made by GitHub Actions in the [Releases](https://github.com/Tremeschin/nVibrant/releases) page

- Remember to run `chmod +x nvibrant*` to mark the file as executable!

### 3. Build it yourself

**Pre-requisites**: Have [git](https://git-scm.com/), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) and GCC Compilers installed, then run:

- `git clone https://github.com/Tremeschin/nVibrant && cd nVibrant`
- `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- `uv run nvibrant-build`

You should have the executable located at `release/nvibrant*`

## üöÄ Usage

**Inputs**: Vibrance Levels are numbers from `-1024` to `1023` that determines the intensity of the effect. Zero being the "no effect" (default at boot), `-1024` grayscale, and `1023` max saturation (200%)

The values are passed as arguments to `nvibrant`, matching the **order of physical ports** in your GPU (not the index of the video server). For example, I have two monitors on HDMI and DisplayPort in an RTX 3060 first two ports, to set vibrance to `512` and `1023` respectively I would run:

```sh
$ nvibrant 512 1023

GPU 0:
‚Ä¢ (0, HDMI) ‚Ä¢ Set Vibrance (  512) ‚Ä¢ Success
‚Ä¢ (1, DP  ) ‚Ä¢ Set Vibrance ( 1023) ‚Ä¢ Success
‚Ä¢ (2, DP  ) ‚Ä¢ Set Vibrance (    0) ‚Ä¢ None
‚Ä¢ (3, DP  ) ‚Ä¢ Set Vibrance (    0) ‚Ä¢ None
‚Ä¢ (4, DP  ) ‚Ä¢ Set Vibrance (    0) ‚Ä¢ None
‚Ä¢ (5, DP  ) ‚Ä¢ Set Vibrance (    0) ‚Ä¢ None
‚Ä¢ (6, DP  ) ‚Ä¢ Set Vibrance (    0) ‚Ä¢ None
```

<sup><b>Note:</b> You might need to set `nvidia_drm.modeset=1` kernel parameter, but I think it's enabled by default on recent drivers.</sup>

If a value is not passed for the Nth physical output, nvibrant will default to zero. When no argument is passed, it will effectively clear the vibrance for all outputs. `None` means the output is disconnected

‚úÖ You might have a display at the later ports, in which case use as:

```sh
$ nvibrant 0 0 0 1023

GPU 0:
‚Ä¢ (0, HDMI) ‚Ä¢ Set Vibrance (    0) ‚Ä¢ None
‚Ä¢ (1, DP  ) ‚Ä¢ Set Vibrance (    0) ‚Ä¢ None
‚Ä¢ (2, DP  ) ‚Ä¢ Set Vibrance (    0) ‚Ä¢ None
‚Ä¢ (3, DP  ) ‚Ä¢ Set Vibrance ( 1023) ‚Ä¢ Success
‚Ä¢ (4, DP  ) ‚Ä¢ Set Vibrance (    0) ‚Ä¢ None
```

### Multiple Displays on Multiple GPUs

If you have multiple displays on multiple GPUs, it _should_ work too:

```sh
# Fictional example, feedback welcome!
$ nvibrant 0 100 512 1023

GPU 0:
‚Ä¢ (0, HDMI) ‚Ä¢ Set Vibrance (    0) ‚Ä¢ Success
‚Ä¢ (1, DP  ) ‚Ä¢ Set Vibrance (  100) ‚Ä¢ Success

GPU 1:
‚Ä¢ (0, HDMI) ‚Ä¢ Set Vibrance (  512) ‚Ä¢ Success
‚Ä¢ (1, DP  ) ‚Ä¢ Set Vibrance ( 1023) ‚Ä¢ Success
```

### Common issues

- If you get a _"Driver version mismatch"_ or `ioctl` errors, maybe try rebooting (if you haven't) since the last driver update. Otherwise, you can force the version with `NVIDIA_DRIVER_VERSION=x.y.z`. It must match what `/dev/nvidia-modeset` expects and is currently loaded in ther kernel.

- It's possible that nVibrant may fail on future or older drivers due to differences between the internal structs and enums in the latest `nvkms` headers. Please report any issues you encounter!

<sup><b>‚ù§Ô∏è Consider</b> [supporting](https://github.com/sponsors/Tremeschin/) my work, this took 16 hours to figure out and implement :)</sup>

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Future work

Integrating this work directly in [libvibrant](https://github.com/libvibrant/) would be the ideal solution, although matching the nvidia driver version could be annoying for a generalized solution. Feel free to base off this code for an upstream solution and PR, in the meantime, here's some local improvements that could be made:

- Package the binary in many linux distros (help needed!)
- Save the current values to restore it later
- Add support for other Display Attributes (Dithering et al.)
- Make an actual CLI interface with `--help`, `--version`, etc.
- I am _probably_ not doing safe-C code or mallocs right :^)
